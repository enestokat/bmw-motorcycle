            <h2>THE BMW</h2>
            <H1>R 1250 RT</H1>
            <P>The new R 1250 RT is your best companion on your trips. The 
                legendary BMW ShiftCam Boxer engine is just as powerful on 
                country roads as it is on winding mountain passes. The new 
                front end has a much more dynamic and slimmer appearance. 
                On the other hand, it also packs a wide range of features 
                such as an extra-large 10.25 inch TFT display or Active 
                Cruise Control (ACC) that will give you more comfort during 
                your journey. At the end of the day, you can sit back and 
                relax knowing that your next trip will go so much better.
